dynamictable
============

JavaScript/jQuery table for data that dynamically and partially updates.

The table can be updated with information (defined using URIs, and is designed
to be sources from RDF/Semantic Web/Linked Data) dynamically, and is therefore
suitable for realtime/updating sources.

The JavaScript that updates and populates the table checks all CSS to ensure
that widths/heights/padding/margins etc are respected, so that developers can
design in CSS, and not have those changes break the table (e.g. setting
different padding in each call works fine, everything remains aligned).
